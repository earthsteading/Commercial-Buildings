# Inspection and surveying checklists for fire sprinkler systems in commercial buildings

"That's a heat detector at the top of the lift shaft.  Therefore it doesn't comply with Spec E1.5 and you need spandrels." - The Brains Trust

## Standards and referenced documents for this inspection checklist
  - [ ] AS2118.1 Automatic fire sprinkler systems
  - [ ] AS2118.6 Combined sprinnkler and hydrant systems in multistorey buildings (highrise = +25m)
  - [ ] AS2118.4 Sprinkler protection for accomodation buildings not exceeding four storeys in height.

## Building componets
See National Construction Dictionary for definitions, synonymous grouping are my own:
 - [ ] CLASSIFICATION: occupancy hazards (light / ordinary / high / hazardous commodities)
 - [ ] TYPES of sprinkler systems: wet (not for freezing conditions), alternative wet-dry (composite alarm), dry (gas pressure for below freezing), pre-action (non-interlock, single interlock, double interlock is safest to avoid inadvertent water discharge), recycling pre-action, deluge (special hazard high velocity sprinklers), tail-end, tail-end anti-freeze.
 - [ ] DESIGN: a sprinkler system (valves, alarms, pipework, sprinklers, water and systems including: wet, alternate wet/dry, pre-action, recycling, deluge, tail-end, anti-freeze), sprinkler compartment, design area enclosure, design density, sprinkler protected area, spray (parabolic discharge pattern below plane of device), DBEP designated building entry point, DSEP designated site entry point, fire/draught stop bulkhead, imperforate non-shatterable material, shielding from cooling, 
 - [ ] DEVICE SENSORS: water motor alarms, monitoring centre trasmitor to fire brigade, valve monitors, alarm signalling equipment (ASE)
 - [ ] DEVICE ACTUATORS: sprinklers (concealed, conventional, dry pendant, dry sidewall, dry upright, extended coverage, flush, high hazard storage), sprayers (medium & high velocity), nozzle extinguisher, NPSH net positive suction head --> pump design, inlet head, atmosphereic pressure, vapour pressure, alarm trigger via pressure fall, alarm valves (wet), alarm valves (dry), non-return valve,  heat sensitive sealed valves, deluge and pre-action valves, stop valves and non-return valves, pressure reducing valves, exhauster flow and fan system for ducts
 - [ ] HUMANS: fire dispatch centre, network utility operator, 
 - [ ] MEASUERMENTS: maximum flow rate =130%, response time index (RTI)
 - [ ] OMITTED: high voltage, farm silos, ovens/kilns, commercial cooking equipment, NCC fire-isolated passageways.

# Detailed drawing requirements
Detailed working drawings and all relevant documentation applicable to the sprinkler system, giving the information below, should be provided to the relevant authority. The drawings should be on an indicated scale not less than l: 100. NOTE: In exceptional cases, a scale of 1:200 may be accepted. 

The drawings should include the following information: 

 - [ ] Name of occupier and owner. 
 - [ ]  Address and location of premises. 
 - [ ]  Point of compass (north point). 
 - [ ]  Key to all symbols used. 
 - [ ]  Hazard class or classes of the system. 
 - [ ]  Occupancy of each building. 
 - [ ]  Constructional details of ceilings, roofs and exterior walls and walls separating sprinkler-protected and non-sprinkler-protected areas. 
 - [ ]  Sectional elevations of each floor of each building indicating the distance of sprinklers from ceilings and structural features that affect the sprinkler layout or distribution from the sprinklers. 
 - [ ]  Location and size of concealed roof or ceiling spaces, offices and other enclosures located at a level lower than the roof or ceiling. All unprotected areas such as stairways, voids (lower levels of lift shafts) and toilets should be indicated on each applicable drawing. 
 - [ ]  Location of ducting, stagings, platforms and other equipment such as machinery, fluorescent light fittings and heaters, which may obstruct the sprinkler distribution. 
 - [ ]  Type, temperature rating and RTI characteristic of each sprinkler. 
 - [ ]  Location and details of any water flow alarm switches or electric alarm pressure switches. 
 - [ ]  The type of system, location of each control assembly and water motor alarm. 
 - [ ]  Location and size of any tail-end air valves, subsidiary stop valves (where permitted) and drain valves. 
 - [ ]  For installations erected on the dry or alternate wet and dry systems, the direction of the drainage slope of the piping. 
 - [ ]  The details of the location and specification of any orifice plate. 
 - [ ]  Hydraulic calculations with detailed and dimensioned working drawings including the following information with the drawings: (i) A node or pipe reference scheme that provides unique identification of pipes, junctions, sprinklers and any in-line devices or fittings that require hydraulic consideration. (ii) The position of the hydraulically most unfavourable design area. (iii) In High Hazard class systems, the location at which the most remote 4 sprinklers upon which the average density of discharge is based. (iv) The location and height above the control assembly of the remote test valve(s). 
 - [ ]  Where required, a line diagram(s) that includes the following information: (A) Node or pipe reference numbers. (B) Distribution pipes under consideration. (C) Range pipes under consideration. (D) Sprinklers under consideration. (E) Identification of the 4 hydraulically most unfavourable sprinklers. (F) Flow through each pipe section and sprinklers. (G) Pressures at each end of each pipe section and at the entry to each sprinkler assumed to be operating.
 - [ ]  A schedule with the number of sprinklers, medium-the area of protection. 
 - [ ]  A summary schedule that states the total area served by each control assembly; the height of the highest sprinkler served by each control assembly; and the type of system, i.e. wet, dry or alternate wet and dry system, and the size of main stop valves. 
 - [ ]  An undertaking that the water supplies comply with, and that the system has been designed to and will be installed in accordance with, this Standard. 
 - [ ]  A detailed drawing of water supplies and piping from the water supplies to the control assembly, indicating the position and type of stop and back-pressure valves and pressure-reducing valves, water meters, water cocks and orifice plates, and any connection other than those for sprinklers. Where the water supplies include a water main, the nominal diameter to be stated and the relevant pressure and flow characteristics, and whether the main is dead-end or circulating; if dead-end, details of the nearest circulating main. 
 - [ ]  Where a compression ignition engine-driven pump is installed, confirmation that the engine is capable of operating continuously on full load at the site elevation for a period of 6 h and that the conditions governing the heating and ventilation of the engine room specified in AS 2941 are complied with. Where automatic pumps form one or both of the supplies, pump characteristic curves to be provided, showing the estimated performance of the pumps under installed conditions.
