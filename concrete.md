## History
Abridged history of cement utilisation in Australia
 - Cement formulated by the Romans and Greeks was made of calcinated gypsum and limestone.  Broken brick was embedded in pozzalanic (siliceous alumimnous) lime mortar and exposed to moisture and calcium hydroxide).  Essentially, the 'cementatious matrix' consisted of lime putty mixed with brick dust or volcanic ash and water.
 - 1790 - 1824 the British in Portland Dorset begin manufacturing dependable hydraulic cement whereby lime with burnt clay would set under water.
 - 1759 the Eddystone Lighthouse footingsin the English Channel 
 - 1911 the largest pubilc structure of its kind, the Melbourne Public Library, was built with a 35 metre steel reinforced dome.

### Advantages
The advantages of concrete in comparison to other primary construction materials (timber, steel, earthen):
 - [ ] Widespread use due to cheapness to produce and speed of construction
 - [ ] Maitenance (surface wear) is relatively low, e.g. no need to paint regularly
 - [ ] Highly resistent to fire (4 hour fire resistence if 165mm thick), especially in comparison to steel and/or treated timber
 - [ ] Elastic modulus is high, e.g. concrete is 1/10th as likely to deform from compression compared to steel
 - [ ] Easily customisable via use in moulds to create any desired shape/dimension
 - [ ] Easy to increase strength via use of additional internal steel
 - [ ] Durable: impermeable to weather actions.
 - [ ] The gradual cooling of cement results in efflorescense, whereby the salt coats the external surface.
 - [ ] Easy to cosmetically repair via patching.

### Disadvantages
The disadvantages of concrete in comparison to other primary construction materials (timber, steel, earthen):
 - [ ] Weaker than most timbers, e.g. 20-40MPa, reduced via reinforcement using interal steel bars.
 - [ ] Tensile strength is low, 10% of it comprehensive strength
 - [ ] Long term deformantion due to creep and shrinkage, e.g. stiffness weakens up to 33% over time.
 - [ ] Steel required to improve internal tensile forces, e.g. 
 - [ ] Environmentally unfriendly, in comparison to timber or earthen construction materials.
 - [ ] For longevity, consistent ingredients and preparation are required.
 - [ ] Suseptable to cavitation (air pockets), which decrease structural rigidity.
 - [ ] Suseptable to spalling (cracking aka concrete cancer) due to water shrinking and expanding.
 - [ ] Poor thermal insulation, but R-value is higher than timber and masonry.
 - [ ] Struturally weaked by fire.

## Requirements for use
To create "good concrete" the careful composition of cement, water, fine/coarse aggregate must be mixed, assuring consistency of:
 - [ ] Expertise in the chemical properties of the materials and design process
 - [ ] Reliable estimates of site conditions and costs
 - [ ] Quality component materials and careful measurements, i.e. min/max aggregate size/shape
 - [ ] Source of mixing water to adjust based on conditions
 - [ ] Thoughtful transport, placement compaction and curing of concrete
 - [ ] Safe and competent direction and supervision, e.g. silica lung injuries and deaths.
 - [ ] Cement classification against standard grade designation for construction strength requirement
 - [ ] Slump value for mechanical/manual handling, compaction and finishing
 - [ ] Pretested pozzolans or checmical admixtures
 - [ ] Cement plant/project control and testing requirements, i.e. acceptable cracking, specific creep, elastic modulus, strength/age ratios, quality variation and serviceability critiera of hardened concrete.
 - [ ] Design density and understanding use for types of lightweight concrete
 - [ ] Efficient curing facilities and tools

## Manufacturing
The process for manufacturing (Portland) cement includes:
 - [ ] Cement oxides: 60-66% lime (CaO) + 19-24% Silican (SiO2) + 1-5% alumina (AI2O3) + 1-5% iron oxide (Fe2O3).  These ingredients are ground together, e.g. the finer the grind the more rapid rate of hydration.
 - [ ] limestone and clay or shale are ground and mixed (wet/dry) and clinkered at 1450°C in a rotating/shaft kiln; with final grinding with 4-6% gypsum which retards the hydration of the aluminate component assuring it won't flash harden/set with the addition of water.
 - [ ] When making concrete, the cement paste (cement+water) absorbs hydration which creates an exothermic chemical reaction which binds the cement to the aggregate (metamorphic quartz, igneous basalt, sedimentary sand(stone) and/or artificial inorganics like crushed brick, scoria, washed river gravel and recycled concrete).  1% too much water weakens the chemical bonds to the aggregate.
 - [ ] Aggregate is gravimetrically weighed (batched) and must be accurately mixed with concrete within a 2% tolerance.
 - [ ] Cement compressive strength is graded based on ratio of water to cement, i.e. Class A cement has 0.5 water/cement ratio which results in a compressive strength of 18.5MPa in 7 days and 30MPa in 28 days.
 - [ ] Ratios of <cement:sand:stone> to <water> determine the compressive strength ergo construction use, e.g. a mix of <1xCement + 1xSand + 2xStone> would be weighed and then 2/5th water by weight added, resulting in a compressive strength of 40MPa (after 28 days curing), which can be used for heavy duty floor surfacing and pre-stressed concrete.  Different ratios of ingredients result in different construction uses, e.g. high strength structural concrete, footing concrete, lean mix road concrete, mass wall concrete, blinding concrete, etc.

## Concrete construction
  - [ ] Concrete layers should be placed in horizontal layers, less than 600mm deep and vibrated/worked to release air and compact into corners of the formwork.  Each layer below should be soft enough to chemically bind to the layer below.  If concrete contains 10% of air voids it is half the strength it could be
  - [ ] Curing concrete is the hardening of silicate gels reacting to hydration which causes exothermic heat in three stages: (a) plastic (workability), (b) setting (cohesiveness), (c) hardening (strength+durability).
  - [ ] Accelerator agents (like calcium dioxide) can increase strength and are necessary for alpine cold weather climates where freezing water can crack concrete before it compacts.
  - [ ] Retarders can slow the stiffening of concrete, i.e. calcium lignosolphate, citric acid, sucrose (sugar), etc.
  - [ ] AS3610 defines 5 classes of finishes with class 1,2 and 3 for typical architectural finishes on visible display; and, class 4 & 5 for non-visible concrete like footings and concrete frames. Form liners are used as molds to produce different aesthetic patterns. Retarders can be utilised for different textures and colour, e.g. oxidising the cement for earth tones.  Tooling for finishes (bushhammering, point tooling, abrasive blasting and hammered nib) must not exceed 8mm with test results verified by a panel prior to proceeding.
  - [ ] Pigments come in the form of granules, powders and liquids which bind into cement like other aggregates.
 
 ### Precast pop-up concrete
 - [ ] Cast _off-site_ concrete panels are made via a qualitry control factory process in smooth steel molds and cured in storage, delivered to the building site (JIT) and installed with specifically engineered fasteners and fixings via a cranelifting them into place.  Braces are used (knee, lateral, end and main brace) along with anchors (tilt prop foot anchor and lifting lugs) to place the panels prior to assembly (using panel ferrules, sealants, etc)
 - [ ] Cast _on-site_ concrete panels are cast atop other panels until cured and crane lifted into place.  This method while requiring a large on-site plant fopotprint is cost effective and requires less exerptise for transport. Chemicals are often used to accelerate drying process and to create a sealant to keep out moisture while the panel is curing.
 - [ ] Panel thickness is usually 150-250mm.  Safety is a significant concern given the fatal risk of a panel falling during it's tilt-up phase.  Construction workers are 150% more likely to experience an accident at work. 
 - [ ] Type of pre-cast panels: (a) cladding/curtain walls for enclosing the buildiong envelope from wind/seismic forces as they don't transfer vertical loads, e.g. walls panels, window wall units, spandrels, mullions and column covers, (b) load-bearing walls for strength/stability of structure, (c) shear walls for lateral loads esp when combined with diaphragam action of floor construction; and (d) formwork for cast-in-place concrete usually for visible aesthetic.
 - [ ] Support/anchorage systems for gravity/lateral connections between panels are tested against: strength, ductility, volume change accomodations, durability, fire resistance and constructability.
 - [ ] Joints and joint treament are measured against: structural, thermal, expansion, differential movement durability and water prevention.
 - [ ] Thermal performance of panels is primarily determined by their thickness.  Structural weaknesses can result from fire and can collapse outward if steel joints are compromised (as opposed to un-reinforced masonry which 'progressively fails' vs tip-over).
 - [ ] Approaches for resisting collapse from fire (resulting heat gradient accross panel will cause the corner to curvve away from the cooler panel midpoint): (a) panels to stand independtly of steel joint framing, (b) design steel joints to not fail during a fire.  Panels and joints must be engineered accordingly, e.g. a tall 2.5m panel would need to be supported by a column with a bending capacity of 50kN-m. Short concerent panels >2.5m would be connected to a supporting column structure (10m spacing) at all four corners via welded flanges, allowing the framework to flex but assuring the panels don't disengage from the supporting columns during a fire.
 - [ ] Panels connected at the top and the bottom must have two connections to the raker members (>2m spacing) or be designed as a single unit with interlocking panels.
 - [ ] End walls columns supported by lighweight columns (with a bending capacity of >50kN-m) must be ridigly conencted to the column/mullion and roof members.
 - [ ] External walls connected to strong columns (<50kN-m) should be connected at the top by flexible connections, which would assure the panels remain upright in fire.
 - [ ] Acoustics: if joints are not well sealed sound transmission can be increased.
 - [ ] Panels will be finished using techniques like: sandblasting, exposing aggregate, acid washing, bush hammering and sealants.
 - [ ] Panel erection is when the panel is at most risk to future problems arising, e.g. anchors used to attach panels can result in panel cracking, displacements or other distress conditions which may not become evident in years.  Quality control of assembly is paramount.
 - [ ] Maitenance of panels (every 7-20 years) include reapplication of sealants, joint corrosion and cracking.
 - [ ] Pre-cast panels must be design for transportation loads (erection loads) and in-service loads, e.g. 'strong-backs' may be required by the engineer during transport and tilt-up. Bracing inserts are installed into panel correctly spaced, including: ground release inserts, solid ferrule inserts, PVC ferrule chairs, grout tube, plastic moulds, shipaks, starter bars, A minimum of 2.5 lifting inserts per lift are required by AS3850 and accompanied by a certification letter from the engineer.
 - [ ] Minimum concrete strength = 25MPa, which usually requires a 28 day curing period.
 - [ ] The manufacturer will provide a letter of certification for concrete panels against the criteria from AS1379, including: (a) conrete specification, (b) minimum final concrete strength after 18 days, (c) results of a sampling program testing MPa strength, (d) casting dates for each panel, and earliest date for panel to be lifted, (e) design drawings with placement of panel in-situ as part of structure, (f) instructions for lifting/installing, (g) design layout for positioning panels on footings/slab, (h) overall layout of structure with bracing removed and permanent joint connections detailed.
 - [ ] Panel drawings should include: (a) date and issue number of drawing, (b) location, orientation and depth of lifting and corresponding inserts, (c) project location, (d) surface finish, (e) panel number and panel mass, (f) dimensional tolerances, (g) panel dimensions and centre of mass, (h) type and brand of lifting inserts, (i) type, size and locatino of steel or other reinforcements, (j) required concrete cover for reinforcement steel, (k) stron-back braces and fixing inserts details (if required), (l) concrete strength required for for lifting and as part of the structure as per AS3600, (m) additional instructions for lifting inserts, e.g. edge distances and proximity of reinforcement.
 - [ ] Panel erection drawings should include: (a) date and issue number of drawing, (b) project location, (c) position of brace connection points on the panel and the ground, (d) brace specifications and/or capacities, (e) levelling pad detials, (f) details for brace footings including dimensions, location, anchor, type and concrete strength at time of erection, and (g) details on keen and lateral bracing (if applicable).

## Joints and connections
 - [ ] Type of tilt-up joint connectors: (a) inserts (lifting, brace and fixings, (b) braces / props (telescopic threads, shear pins, brace foot pin, roof bracing systems, etc), (c) crane capacity checked against charts, e.g. 50 ton hydraulic crane can lift a 10-15 ton panel or a 200 ton crane can lift up to a 50 ton panel max, (d) tools for welding/bolting/dowling conectors and leveling pads/shims for minor adjustment of panels.
 - [ ] Design criteria for connections: (a) structural adequecy, i.e. forces (compression, tension, flexure, shear, torsion) over lifetime: gravity, wind, earthquake, soil/water pressure, (b) ductility, i.e. ability to be deformed before failure, (c) accomodatino for volume change, i.e. flexibility for shrinkage, creep and temperature differences, (d) durability, i.e. galvanised, hot-dipped or stainless steel to resist corrosion, (e) fire resistance, e.g. protection from metal melting, (f) production simplicity, e.g. less complexity is good engineering, (g) construction simplicity, e.g. time is money.

## Columns
 - [ ] Columns failure is a result of: (a) concrete strength, (b) slenderness of the column, (c) columns ability to resist shear/tensile stresses. Load carrying capacity for columns are designed by structural engineers. Lateral ties (ligatures/fitments/coils/hoops) wrap around longitudal bars to resist buckling/bursting of bars from the thin layer of concrete surrounding them.  Stronger reinforced concrete mixes (20-65MPa) are required for columns.
 - [ ] Required concrete structure specification: (a) referncee number and date of issue for applicable AS Standard, (b) imposed actions (live lods) used in design, (c) earthquanke design category as per AS1170, (d) construction constraints, (e) exposure durability classification, (f) Fire Resistence Level, (g) class and grade designatin of concrete, (h) required properties of concrete, (i) curing procedure, (j) grade, ductility class and rype of reinformance grade/type of tendons, (k) size, quantity, location of all reinforcement tendons, structural fixings and covers, (l) location of splices, mechanical connections and weldings, (m) maximum jacking force for each tendon, (n) shape and size of each member, (o) finish method for unformed surfaces, (p) class of formwork for surface finish as per AS3610, (q) minimum period of time before strippiin of form work and removal of shore, and (r) locatino of planned construction and movement joints including protection.
 - [ ] Example specification labels in drawings: SL92 is the style of standard for D500L fabric covering; 8-N28 is the number (8) of 16mm deformed bars of Grade D500N in layer or cross-section; 20-N16-200 is the number (20) of 16mm plain round bars of Grade D500N spaced at 200mm centres; 6-R10-150-T1 is the number of 10mm plain round bars of grade RISON used for fitments of shape T1 and spaced at 150mm centres;  ARCN102 is R500N mesh with 10mm nominal diameter wires at 200 mm centres each way covering the whole area of a slab. There is no need to specify either the number of sheets required to proviae full coverage or the lap dimension.    
 - [ ] Reinforcement steel: hotl rolled steel (cured at 1150°C), micro-alloyed deformed bar and coil aka N12 / N16 / N40 / D450 N50 mill bars (low carbon, micro-alloyed high strength hot rolled reinforcing bar using vanadium or similar alloying element), quench and self tempered deformed bar QST (hot carbon hot rolled steel water cooled self tempering martensite with austentic core) and hot drawn and cold rolled bar (low carbon and yield stress of 300MPa as per AS/NZ4671).                       
 - [ ] Column tensions: elastic moduls of steel is about 15x that of concrete, e.g. if steel is stressed to 14N/mm2 is will shatter the concrete.  The concrete takes the compressive stresses and teh steel takes the tensile stresses.                              
 - [ ] Bending/cutting steel reinforcement bars is defined by AS3600, i.e. 4db for 12mm and 16mm bars; 5db for 20mm and 24mm bars, 6db for 28mm and 40mm bars.  Curtting N12 bars is possible by bolt cutters, for larger gauges a mechanical shear or oxyacetylene equipment should be used. 
 - [ ] Welding reinforcement of steel bars as per AS/NZS4671 + AS1554: Grade 500N are the most weldable high strength reinforcing bars, particularly for butt-welding, tack-welding and lap splice welds.
 - [ ] Fire-resistance level: fire temperatures above 200*C reduce the strength of both steel and concrete.  Covers of columns are required as per NCC Vol.1 FRL requirements.
