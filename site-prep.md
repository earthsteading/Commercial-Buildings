 - [ ] Rolled fill: rolled fill of sand should not be deeper than 600mm with 300mm compacted layers, repeatedly rolled with excavator.  Materials other than sand should be compacted at 150mm thick.
 - [ ] Sloping sites using cut-and-fill: compacted fill must be carried pas the edge of the building evelope by +1m which is retained/battered to prevent erosion (not steeper than 2horizontal:1vertical).
 - [ ] Engineer designed retaining walls for piling.
 - [ ] Fill/soil stabalisation: (a) bearing capacity can be increased via removal of poor quality clay/foundation and replaced with +1m of above ^^ fill methods (provided adequate soil settlement prior to beuild commencing); (b) use of lime to stabalise water-logged clay soils, e.g. add up to 10% lime blended and compacted/rolled/vibrated in 150mm layers which reduces plasticity of soil, increases strenth/bearing capacity and drains more freely.  NB must use hydrated lime aka builder's lime (calcium oxide Ca0), NOT agricultural lime (calcium carbonate CaCO3).

## Footings for commercial structures
 - [ ] Types of footings (below): spread footing, wide strip footing, reinforced concrete pads, continous columns footing, combinedfooting , raft footing, solid footing, beam and slab, cellular, pile footing (friction or displacement piles, end bearing, pile groups).
 - [ ] Type of piles/piers (below): driven tube piles, toe driven tube piles, timber piles, stell piles, bored piles, cylinder piles, auger-fed piles, jacked piles, rectangular concrete piles, soil compacting piles and pier cylinder+monolith (caison) footings.  Under pinings: continous or piled.
 - [ ] Spread footing: weak soil and/or heavy lods require wide spread resulting in a thick mass of concrete which are excessively deep
 - [ ] Wide strip footing: for load-bearing walls including brick/concrete for multi-storey buildings.
 - [ ] Reinforced concrete pads footings: reinforced rectangular slab carrying a single column.
 - [ ] Continous column footing: supports line of columns via combined footing, which is different than continous strip footing which is for load-bearing brick/concrete panels.
 - [ ] Combined footing: cantilever footing + balanced base footing (used as alternative to trapevoidal combined footing slab, or for providing a footing when a column position is not directly below, e.g. when placed clost to an adjoining property wall.
 - [ ] Raft footings (below are large slab footings to cover the whole or a large part of the site).
 - [ ] Solid slab raft: reinforced in both directions 't' rebar ties.
 - [ ] Beam and slab raft: thick (300mm) slab on floor with beams projecting above it.

 - [ ] Normal cellular raft: basements encased slab which is monolithic and diveds entire basement into cellular compartments.

## Piling for commercial structures
 - [ ] Factors for utiling pilings: (a) load bearing capacity of soil (friction of pile), (b) high water table, (c) type of structure being built, (d) geological conditions found on site, e.g. to reach bedrock like foundation aka 'end bearing' on limestone or friction of clay on pile to retain position, (e) special design needs, e.g. resistence to slip, (f) specification/standards relating to construction type.

 - [ ] Issue 'Pile Lengths Letter' authorising pile lengths so Contractor can order the correct length of concrete piles from the pre-stres yard.

### Note on durability of screw piles
  - [ ] Screw piles have a lengthy history of use in difficult conditions including sea piers and other harsh conditions throughout the world.
  - [ ] Screw pile use in commercial construction: replacing bored piers and CFA piles, replacing driven piles, replacing blinding concrete, replacing concrete pads and stumps for timber floors, load capacities up to 2400Kn ultimate, unlimited length potential, commercial high rise up to 6 storeys, angle of repose for easements and sewer and for eco-sensitive sites.
  - [ ] Screw pile use in civil construction: foundations for light poles and transmission towers, foundations for signs, foundations for bridges and walkways, ground and land slip stabilisation, foundations for shade structures.

### Dewatering and pressure belief during excavation
 - [ ] Dewatering is used for small excavation and dense well-graded or cemented soils.
 - [ ] Type of dewatering: sheeting / open pumping, deep well sumps, wellpoint systems (most common), pressure relief wells, electrical drainage via electro osmosis.

## Excavation of basements
 - [ ] Why build a basement: (a) cheaper to build closer to the gound, (b) provision of facilities (like plant room, parking and storage), and (c) structural forming as part of the footing.
 - [ ] Basement construction difficulties: (a) type of material being excavated (rock fault planes, shoring of sandy/clay materials), (b) ground water conditions (cost increases when building below water table), (c) cost of battering (to avoid excavation shoring systems), and (d) back-filling of basement walls with imported granular free draining material which resists soil consolidation problems using sheet piling, and (e) fault lines in shale foundations.
- [ ] Basement walls must resist actions: (a) earth pressure (vertical pressure transmitted into horizontal force via 'angle of repose'), and (b) hydrostatic pressure (horizontal pressure and vertical upward pressure).
 - [ ] Methods for building a basement: geotextile overlaid and encasing entire basement (to resist hydrostatic pressure leaks, load bearing walls, deep beams (supporting columns), columns and infill walls (horizontal) and/or floors and infill walls (vertical support).
 - [ ] Basement terminology: open cut, sheet pilin, bored piles, diaphragm walls, seperate retaining walls (soldier/rock anchors and 'progressive basement construction'), deep cellular basement, stiff raft basement, solid slab raft, beam and slab raft, formed raft and soil.

## Shoring systems
 - [ ] Type of shoring systems: discrete piles with shortcrete walls between piles, contigous piling systems, secant-pile wall system, dead shores, raking shores, sheet piling with shortcrete wall, diaphragm walls aka slurry walls, caissons and copherdams. 
 - [ ] NB Shortcreting cracking and corrosion is a common problem.
 - [ ] Underpinning is used for transferring the weight of an existing structure to a new permanent structure (often via a temporary support structure).  Underpinning is used for improving the foundation of an adjoining building, e.g. deep excavations adajent to existing buildings, improving the foundation for additional storeys and/or due to foundation failure from sheering, tree death or drainage.
 - [ ] Process for underpinnings: (a) soil tests to determine load bearing capacity of soil, (b) engineer design, (c) notify council for permit, (d) notify owner and adjoining properties as per Building Regulations, (e) survey of building including any potential damage (photographic evidence of cracks against ruler, etc), (f) underpinning begins, (g) wegiht of structure taken by shores or jacks, e.g acrow props, (h) order of engineer's instructions followd exactly, (i) council inspections for each new excavation and concrete pour, (j) existing footing wire bruched or scabled prior to grouting, (k) decision on fotting to be repaired or poured anew with reinforcement.  NB legal and insurance engaged throughout.

## Retaining walls
 - [ ] Job for specialist engineers to calculate the 'angle of repose', e.g. sand angle-of-repose is 30-35 degrees, crushed rock back-fill is 35-40 degrees.
 - [ ] Gravity walls must assure: (a) pressure on earth at toe of wall is not greater than the earth can resist, i.e. settlement of foundation can lead to overturning, (b) thrust of soil on wall preferably falls inside the middle third of the base, thus ensuring only compressive stresses, and (c) no tendency for walls to slide, or for clay cohesion not to slip because of shear failure. 
 - [ ] Concrete cantaliver walls for heights up to 8m: "L" shaped wall with earth pressing down on base of wall, the base will be equal to 50% of the height of the wall.  If base is unable to be projected into earth, then the base must be more than 33% of the design height of the wall to resist overturning.  Ribs can be used in addition.
 - [ ] Concrete counterforts (ribs) walls for walls for wall +8m: monolithic beam and walls as continous slab with points of support called "counterforts" (butresses) which provide vertical support.
 - [ ] Crib walls for terraces and embankments up to 5m (for walls up to 10m triple width cribs/headers/stretchers are required to achieve adequate mass): are precast concrete boxes filled with soil and battered to a slope of 1:6 (or less than 1:8).  Filling should be course sand, gravel or crushed rock and should extend 900mm behind the crib to form a drainage layer.
 - [ ] Basement walls: see above basement design requirements as footing/piling within foundations.
