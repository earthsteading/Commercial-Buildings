# Checklist for fire combustion in external walls

The following provides a checklist for investigating fire combustion of external walls in commerical buildings.

  - [ ] fixed, installed, attached = building component is connected by mechanical and/or checmical fixings.

# Checklists

## human checklist

## machine checklist
The below code is written in ruby with the following commands strictly defined:
 - [x] IF = The code between if and end is executed when the expression evaluates to true.
 - [ ] UNLESS = Executes code if conditional is false. If the conditional is true, code specified in the ELSE clause is executed.
 - [x] ELSE = An if statement can include an else clause to specify code to be executed if the condition is not true.
 - [x] ELSIF = ELSE+IF
 - [x] WHEN = case expressions (when+puts) is an alternative to the if-elsif-else expression.
 - [x] PUTS
 - [x] END

if-elsif-else expression:
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby

x = 1
if x > 2
   puts "x is greater than 2"
elsif x <= 2 and x!=0
   puts "x is 1"
else
   puts "I can't guess the number"
end
```
Case expression example:
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby

$age =  5
case $age
when 0 .. 2
   puts "baby"
when 3 .. 6
   puts "little child"
when 7 .. 12
   puts "child"
when 13 .. 18
   puts "youth"
else
   puts "adult"
end
```
