Notes from Professional Development Training Kingspan Insulation with Robert Sebek on 2023-02-22

(a) Physical properties of rigid insulation: 
   - thermoplatics: melts and smokes (++SMOGRA)
   - thermoset: phenolic & pyrolysis

(b) Rigid insulation boards in more detail
   - NCC Spec C1.10 Fire hazard

(c) Fire hazard testing properties AS 1530 Parts 1-3 (1994-1999)
   - Part 3: small scale test where materials is gradually moved towards heat source: ignitability, flame propogation, heat evolved, smoke developed.
   - Part 2: different test for flammability of materials.
   - Part 1 Combustibility is a small scale test and is therefore not suitable for all situations (45mm x 55mm test chamber) - calls for changes in testing post caldding fires, re NCC C1.9.
   - AWTA Product Testing Report or  CodeMark Certificate of Conformity required.

(d) Determination of group lining number AS/ISO9705 & AS 5637.1
   - Additional testing required by NCC2020 = full scale room testing with ceiling and wall all at the same time.
   - Fire report to include: Group number & SMOGRA
   - Example of PIR vs Kooltherm Soffit boards with silver/white foil face (installed prior to service insultation)

(e) Post Lacrosse cladding building fire
   - ABCB Advisory Note (Aug 2016): external wall elements
   - If no AS 1530 Part 1 done for material, then Performance Solution must be done by Fire Safety Engineer and ESD consultant via Fire Engineering Report (including liaise with Fire Brigade).

(f) Thermal insulation for buildings AS 4859 (2018)
   - Thermal bridging standard for R-value.
   - PIR boards have a different ageing process than 
   - NZS uses NZS 4214 (2006) for calculating total thermal resistance for parts of buildings.
   - Thermographic imaging of walls being used
