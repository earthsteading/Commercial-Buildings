Advantages of timber:
 - [ ] naturally occuring organic polymer
 - [ ] small tubular structure enables good sound, electrical and heat insulation
 - [ ] aesthetically pleasing (especially for primates)
 - [ ] well tested and regulated as a structural material for buildings worldwide
 - [ ] depending on design, easy to repair and modify
 - [ ] ecologically sustainable (depending on forestry logging principles and metrics)
 - [ ] stores carbon (unlike steel/concrete)

Disadvantages of timber:
 - [ ] popularity of product has resulted in mass deforestation and monoculture for using a few specific species in building, despite over 30,000 tree species available worldwide.
 - [ ] treatment of wood to enable logevity of building results in a product which is toxic to recycle, e.g. eood is treated with termite, bushfire, hardening, paints and other synthetic chemicals
 - [ ] durability of timber is limited in comparison with steel, concrete and/or earthen materials
 - [ ] suseptable to biological attack, termites, borers, etc.
 - [ ] decays easily underground
 - [ ] flammable

### Timber hazard levels
 - [ ] There are 7 hazard classes for timber, based on their durability both above ground and below, including:
 - [ ] H1 hazard class: 25 years in ground / more than 40 years above ground, e.g. belian, cypress-white, ironbark, tallowwood, turpentine, yellow cedar, northern box, etc
 - [ ] H2 hazard class: 15-25 years in ground / 15-40 years above ground, e.g. blackbutt, kwila (merbau), spotted bum, western red cedar, river red gum, teak, etc.
 - [ ] H3 hazard class: 5-15 years in ground / 7-15 years above ground, e.g. bruch box, rose gum, flooded gum, sydney blue gum, taun, kempas, kapur, american white oak, etc
 - [ ] H4 hazard class: 0-5 years in ground / 0-7 years above ground, e.g. baltic pine, carribbean pine, douglas fir - oregon, radiata pine, slash pine, mountain ash tasmanian oak, alpine victorian ash, keruing, east asian kauri, etc.
 - [ ] H5 hazard class
 - [ ] H6 hazard class
 - [ ] H6SW hazard class

### Selecting timber
 - [ ] Structures: soft and hardwood; heartwood and sapwood
 - [ ] Appearance: colour, grain, texture, figure
 - [ ] Properties: density, moisture movement, durability of heartwood, fatigue effect, strength, temperature effect, preservative treatment effect, joint strength, hardness, thermal properties, electrical conductivity, chemical resistence, corrosive action, acoustic properties.
 - [ ] Utilisation: grading and weathering
 - [ ] Environmental sources: managed native forests (logged to minimise impact on native flora/fauna) and regenerative planned 9monoculture) forests to exceed logging rates.
 - [ ] Construction uses: formwork for concrete, light building framing, portals, trusses, large span roofs, floors, arches, etc.
 - [ ] Limitations: serviceability (vibration, load deflection), strength (<5% liklihood of failure over lifetime), stability (easily attached and remain together), fire loading (won't collapse for a period of time), fatigue (tolerance for bending before breaking, not rigid like steel/concrete).
 - [ ] Compression capacity: buckling (function of slenderness/stiffness), stability, compressive strength, capacity of compression, e.g. narrow leaves red ironbark (eucalyptus creba) as a hardwood has a density of 1.090 g/cm3 and compression strength of 70 MPa; lemon scented gum aka spotted gum (corymbia maculata) as a hardwood has a density of 1.010 g/cm3 and a compression strength of 75 MPa; southern blue gum (eucalyptus globulus) as a hardwood has a density of 0.829 g/cm3 and a compressive strength of 83MPa; jarrah (eucalyptus marginata) as a hardwood has a density of 0.860 g/cm3 and a compression strength of 61MPa; Tasmanian oak aka Victorian mountain ash has a density of 0.700 g/cm3 and a compression strength of 70MPa; compared with softwood species like white cypress pine and/or monterey pine which have density of 0.675 and 0.545 g/cm3 with compressions strengths of 53 and 42 MPa.
 - [ ] Failure modes: material failure (crushing) and buckling failure (geometric).
 - [ ] Beam design: strength limits (bending, shearing and bearing capacity, span limits (light, moderate and heavy loads).
 - [ ] Engineereed timber: LVLs (laminated veneer lumber), glulam (glue laminated beams), plywood web I joists and box beams, trusses with steel/timber web members, etc.
 - [ ] Deflection limits (tolerance for loading): total deflection, live load deflection, dead load only deflection, long term load loading deflection, etc.
 - [ ] Creep: visco-elastic deformation and moisture affected deformation, esp dry/wet cycles.
 - [ ] Duration of load: strength limit state (sum of all load events resulting in prgressive damange to fibres), serviceability limit state (sum of all load where duration of load assocated with stretching/squashing of fibres and where creep recovery does not occur).
 - [ ] Stiffness: 'E-values' = the mean stiffness for that populatin of boards (+/- 50% per board variance)
 - [ ] Orthotropic (directional properties): shear strength is weakest accross the grain.
 - [ ] Bearing strength (not the same as bending strength): bearing must be 75mm+ from the end of the beam AND the bearing length must be less than 150mm.
 - [ ] Flexural strength/failure of bending members: material failure (crushing/tension), buckling failure (geometric).
 - [ ] Strength sharing factors: combined systems (beams connected side by side via nail lamination), or discrete systems (closely spaced parallel beams connected by crossing elements, e.g. floor joists/bridges).
 - [ ] Stability factor: slender beams are suseptable to lateral torsion buckling and is best avoided by providing lateral restraint to the beam at the critical/compression edge.
 - [ ] Combined actions on timber: bending/compression (portal frame members), bending/tension (roof truss members).

### Connection principles for timber:
 - [ ] Joint groups for timber density: unseasoned timber J1-J6 and for seasoned timber JD1-JD6
 - [ ] Minimum nail/screw/bolt spacing: spacing location (end distance, edge distance, between nails along grain, between nails accross grain) + code requirement (D = Diameter of nail) = total number of nails for distance.
 - [ ] Types of nailed connections: pre-bring of holes (hardwood), nail plate connections (truss, beam lamination), nailed gusset connection (portal frame rigidity, glulam portal members, ply-webbed box I beams), scew nailing (obligue nails which cross at centre line of beam).
 - [ ] Types of screwed connections (to resistwithdrawal loads by 3x holding strenth compared to nails): taper threaded wood screws, type 17 self drilling, self-tapping screws, no.4 wood screws, etc.
 - [ ] Characteristics of bolted connections: diameter of bolt (affecting bearing surface area), thickness of timber member (affecting bearing surface area), orientation of force to grain (affecting bearing capacity), joint group of timber (J1-J6 & JD1-JD6 to indicate timber density), and strength group of timber (S1-S7 unseasoned & SD1-SD7 for seasoned timber).  For example, unseasoned mixed Australian hardwoods would have a design density of 1050 kg/m3 (vs) seasoned mixed pine densities would have a design density of 550 kg/m3.
 - [ ] Variations of bolted connections: coach screws, large diameter (>8mm) steel dowels, sheer-plate connectors and split ring connectors.
 - [ ] Trade-offs for using 'nail vs bolt' connections: nails part fibres (vs) drilled holes break wood fibres; small diameter nails enable flexibility (vs) large diameter bolts enable rigidity; nails transfer force via bearing and friction (vs) bolts transfer force by bearing only; etc.
 - [ ]  - [ ] "Horses for courses" <=> 'connectors for designers' - different timbers types will respond differently to nails/screws/bolts/plate connections. 

### Architectural detailing for timber structures
 - [ ] Shielding: use of landscaping (overhangs, pergolas, screens, fences, capping, flashing, fascias, barges, plants, etc) near external timber structures can increase the wet/dry cycle timeber expedriences resulting in deformation.
 - [ ] Isolation
 - [ ] Moisture trap: gaps between timber members should be kept to a minimum, and (if used) drainage holes should be included to assure water doesn't soak into timber, e.g. timber enclosed in sockets/shoes exposed to weather should be avoided.
 - [ ] Ventilation and condensation: particularly for wet areas and spaces under floors.  Risk mitigations would include: (a) for cold climates a regularly maintained heating cycle, (b) for kitchens ventilation via extraction fans, (c) use of vapour barriers and sarking to isolate timber joints on warmer side of wall, (d) for hot climates where air-conditioning / evaporative-cooling is used special considerations must be employed accounting for hot/cold/wet cycles.  To avoid condensation, vapour barriers must be placed on the warm side of the wall.
 - [ ] Joint connection detailing design principles: 
 - [ ] (a) avoid restraint due to shrinkage, e.g. stain/finishes and sealants for end-grain, align fasteners along member joints, use single fasteners at joints, use connections which allow for movement, use seasoned timber, drill holes 10% oversize in unseasoned timber, 
 - [ ] (b) use corrosive resistant metals, e.g. stainless steel grade 316, for marine monel screws or silicane bronze nails (must not touch aluminium), galzanised/mechnically plated/dipped for expose to weather, zinc/cadmium/gold plated for corrosive environments; and, mild steel for internal indoor use not exposed to moisture.
 - [ ] (c) minimise moisture traps and exposed contact areas: see above.
 - [ ] (d) allow for shrinkage or differential movement, e.g. use similar wood types throughout build, allow for vertical movement by leaving adequate clearance at the top of masonry veneer.
 - [ ] (e) use the correct fastener and installation technique for the type of timber being used (avoid splitting!), e.g.  use bullet head plain shank nails for hardwood cladding, use flat head plain shank nails for painted softwood cladding, use galvanised deformed shank flat head nail for unpainted CCA-treated framing.
 - [ ] (f) design should enable ease of replacement.

### Nail types
 - [ ] Head for pneumatic guns: T-nail, D-head, flat head, pin head, pin less head
 - [ ] Point types: diamond point at 35 degrees (standard nail point used), pencil/chisel/dump points (for concrete/timber connection), blunt/shear point (to avoid splitting from diamond point)
 - [ ] Shank and head types: plain shank (standard nail shank used for timber to timber), annular ring spiral shanks (for holding power in hardwood, esp flooring, panelling, gusset plates, cladding, underlay, finishing, roofing, plasterboard), rinkg nail shanks (holding, but not for shock loads, as rings tear fibres once moved).
 - [ ] Nail materials: cold drawn low carbon steel (standard nail material), aluminium (sheeting), for marine/corrosive environments (copper, brass, silicon-bronze, stainless stell and monel).
 - [ ] Common nail types: bullet head nail (timber framing), flat head nail (metal connectors and softwood framing), flex sheet nail, hardboard nail, wallboard nail, flex sheet nail, soft sheet nail, clout, plasterboard, decking spike, duplex nail, roofing nail, fencing staple, etc.
 - [ ] Preferred diameter+length combinations: for pneumatic guns diameter of 2-3mm and length of 50-90mm.

### Screw types
 - [ ] Traditional: countersunk head for general finishing, raised counter sunk head for aesthetic.
 - [ ] Self-drilling: hexagon washer head for roof sheet fixing, countersunk head for wood to wood connections, wafer head for metal fasteners to wood connections, bugle head for wood to wood connection where uplift may be severe.
 - [ ] Finishes, same as nails see above.
 - [ ] Preferred diameter+length combination: see standards AS1476 + AS3566.

### Bolt and coach screws
 - [ ] Head type: hexagon with washers and cup with our without washers - both with tensile strength of 400MPa.
 - [ ] Finishes, Zinc coated either hot dipped galvanised is preferred (esp for swimming pools, bridges, marine structures, farms) or electro-plated.
 - [ ] Preferred diamter+length combination: diameter M6-M8 length 150, diameter M10-M36 length 200.

### Glued products
 - [ ] LVL & LSL manufactured by bonding seasoned wood veneers/strands together (either cross-banded or parallel to the length) with adhesive, which results in higher bending strength and stiffness than the equivalent timber on its own.

### Curing and maitenance of timber
 - [ ] Seasoned timber should: be kept dry (MC<15%) so as not to decay; similarily, timber immersed where oxygene is not included will not decay; avoidance of insect pest attacks.
 - [ ] Timber is hygroscopic so it absorbs and releases moisture in sympathy with surrounding environment.
 - [ ] Four-coat oil based paint systems provide more vapour barrier than two coat acrylic systems.
 - [ ] Exterior grade stains and water repellents require more frequent re-application to maintain water resistant finish
 - [ ] sawn surfaces provide a better 'key' for stains and water repellents to absorb into, particularly for denser species.
 - [ ] rounded edges provide a better 'eky' for paint finishes.
