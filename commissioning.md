# Evidence to be gathered for commercial structures 

## Performance Solutions
 - [ ] note on performance solutions for commercial buildings: the variety of Performance Solutions for commercial buildings is varietous and requires signinificant effort to assure all evidence from expert consultants is collected.

## Air conditioners
 - [ ] Measure ceiling, floor and window areas in cubic meatures and ask advice on which air-conditioners is the right size, e.g. too powerful an AC will result in too much humidity resulting in a damp feeling and potentially condensation.
 - [ ] Type of air-conditioners: central ducted air conditioner, wind and through the wall, split system, multi-split system, and portable.  Inverter systems installed on each will enable greater control of fan speed and cooling temperature and are arguably more energy efficient.  Reverse cycle systems can also provide heating.
