# SOUs in apartment buildings
Single Occupancy Units

## Ventilation options

1. System A
The key benefits of this system are:
• Extremely high indoor air quality and thermal comfort
• Significantly reduces the build-up risk of moisture
• Energy efficiency

The key limitations of this system are:
• Additional capital cost, likely around $8-10k per apartment
• Largest spatial impact

2. System B
The key benefits of this system are:
• Façade penetrations reduced
• Ceiling Grille Option – Low cost and maintenance, while still maintaining good condensation
control
• Trickle Vent Option – Enhanced natural ventilation in bedrooms through the use of trickle
vents, improves air quality and moisture management, even if the windows are closed

The key limitations of this system are:
• Inclusion of Fire and Smoke damper for every apartment will increase cost and maintenance
• Pandemic response compromised as outdoor air is taken from a shared space
• Additional outside air risers and larger corridor tempering systems may be required
• Ceiling Grille Option – Thermal comfort and air quality compromised
• Trickle Vent Option – Suppliers for trickle vents within Australia are limited and may not be
compatible with certain window systems, and many have a significant cost. Likely impose
extensive acoustic treatment to minimise noise breakouts.

3. System C
The key benefits of this system are:
• Low installation and maintenance costs
• Ceiling Grille Option – Low cost and maintenance, while still maintaining good condensation
control
• Trickle Vent Option – Enhanced natural ventilation in bedrooms through the use of trickle
vents, improves air quality and moisture management, even if the windows are closed.
The key limitations of this system are:

• Ceiling Grille Option – Thermal comfort and air quality compromised
