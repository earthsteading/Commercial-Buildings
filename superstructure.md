## Grid structures

 - [ ] Roof applications: space frames aka isotropic vector matrix or in a single unit width octet truss (for spanning large spaces, like stadiums), flat grids, folded grids, folded lattice plates, braced barrel vaults and braced domes.
 - [ ] Advantages of structure: 3D rigidity, larger spans at lower heights, freeom of design, eliminates mid-columns, spacious, high load bearing, functional aesthetic, integral cladding, modularity, less transportation cost, easy to expand, assembly line economics, seismic resistant

## Trusses (timber, concrete and steel)

  - [ ] A truss is a braced triangulated frame designed to act as a beam.  The advantages of a truss (over a standard I-beam or tube) is that all members of a truss are in either pure tension or compression due to their configuration as a series of triangle, parallelogram or polygone faces.  
  - [ ] All joints are hinged (free to rotate) and therefore all loads are uniformly applied to all joints, e.g., a member can only push or pull along the line of the member.  
  - [ ] The parts of a truss are the tension tie (hinge joint) and the compression strut (or X pattern cables), which compose the web of the truss.
  - [ ] Types of russes: Howe, Warren and Pratt
  - [ ] Castellated or cellular beams are used for long spans and service integrations

## Steelwork connections
 - [ ] Grade 250 steel is the most used for commercial buildings and comes in two types: (i) plate mill in flat plate form (AS/NZS 3678 250 XLERPLATE@ (with thickness up to 5mm) or, (ii) hot strip mill in coil form AS/NZS1594 HA25O XLERCOIL@ (with thickness up to 12mm).
 - [ ] The two forms of 250 steel vary in regards to surface scale (coil plate better for laser cutting), silicon content (coil plate is better for galvanizing), flatness (plate mill is flatter), grain structure (coil plate is better for bending, flat place is more uniform) and dimensional tolerances.
 - [ ] Other types of steel: mild steel (low strength carbon steel not standardised), wrought iron aka decorative frieze work aka worked mild steel (highliy malleable, grows stronger as it is worked), universal steel sections comply with Australian quality standards (universal "I" beams, "C" channels aka PFC, universal "I" columns, "L" angles, welded beams, fabricated beams aka cestellated/cellular beams).
 - [ ] Steel connections: bolted (shear/lapped) connections, moment (flange/end plate) connections and friction-type connections.
 - [ ] Bolting as per AS4100: category 8.8T/TF/TB bolts must be tightened (fully tensioned, snug, part-turn) using a standard podger spanner.  Schematics must include installatin, tightening and inspection instructions. Load indicator washers provide feedback to indicate tension (AS1252).
 - [ ] Design details for bolts and pins should include: minimum pitch, minimum edge distance, maximum pitch, maximum edge distance, inspection tests.
 - [ ] Fabrication techniques for steel: full contact splies (cold saw cutting or maching), cutting (sawing, shearing, cropping, machine and thermal cuting), holing (flame cut, drilled, sub punched), bolting (see above), surface prep (cleaning/removal of excess material), bearing type connections use applied oil finishes, galvanized joints, and welding (see below)
 - [ ] Welding steel (principal joining technique): fillet weld (between faces of connected 'T' or 'L' plates), butt weld (between to continous plates), complete penetration butt weld (throughout the entire depth of the welded joint), and intermittent fillet welds. Weld defects: root gap and lack of root fusion.
 - [ ] Standard connection types for steel members: angle seat, bearing pad, flexible end plate, angle cleat, web side plate, fully welded, bolted moment end plate, welded splices, bolted splices, bolted knee joint, apex joint, base plate and web copes.
 - [ ] Erection procedures as per AS4100: full contact splices, cutting, welding, holing, bracing, bolting, tensioning and grouting.
 - [ ] The design drawing shall include: (a) size and designation of each member, (b) number, sizes and categories of bolts used in connection, (c) sizes, types and categories of welds and visual examination required, (d) sizes of connection components, (e) location and details of joints, connections and splices, (f) any constraint on construction assumed in the design.
