### Truss components
  - [ ] A truss is a braced triangulated frame designed to act as a beam.  The advantages of a truss (over a standard I-beam or tube) is that all members of a truss are in either pure tension or compression due to their configuration as a series of triangle, parallelogram or polygone faces.  
  - [ ] All joints are hinged (free to rotate) and therefore all loads are uniformly applied to all joints, e.g., a member can only push or pull along the line of the member.  
  - [ ] The parts of a truss are the tension tie (hinge joint) and the compression strut (or X pattern cables), which compose the web of the truss.
  - [ ] Types of russes: Howe, Warren and Pratt
  - [ ] Castellated or cellular beams are used for long spans and service integrations
