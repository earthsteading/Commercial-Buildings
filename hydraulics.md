# Ducting
Flexible and rigid ductwork for both internal and external service installation to buildings.

## Flexible ductwork
AS 4254 Part 1
Checklist for flexible pipe ducting for liquids and air handling:
 - [ ] Provide evidence for airtight, vapour-tight and UV stabalised ducting including the jacket-sleeve, duct-tape, sealant and mastics which encapsulates the ducting pipes.  Both UL181 (mould growth, temperature, puncture, loading, impact, pressure, collapse, tension and burning) and AS1530 (smoke developed index not greater than three and spread-of-flame index less than zero) tests should be provided for all ducting componets.

 - [ ] Joints connecting flexible ducting (to terminals, rigid ducts, duct joiners, etc) must be sealed (collars, jackets, ducting tape, sealants, etc) 
 - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/206045574-ff1772ef-16f1-4634-9ac3-b6f3aeddae1c.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/206045707-7144d850-5990-46b6-9bdf-75febe6316a2.png)
 - [ ] Ducts must be supported using load distribution systems structurally connected to weightbearing building elements to assure no sagging, shaffing and/or distoration. 
 - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/206046359-444dbc5f-f267-463f-9a9e-605035688ed2.png)
 - [ ] Corners and bends in ductwork must be supported before and after bend.  Sharp edges shall be trimmed to prevent punctures.

 - [ ] Ducting shall be labelled including name of manufacturer, conformance/testing requirements and insulation R-value.

 - [ ] Test reports are valid for ten years

## Rigid ductwork
Checklist for rigid ductwork primarily for air handling as per AS 4254 Part 2:
  - [ ] Ductwork shall have a pressure classification and galzanised steel thickness appropriate to use.
  - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/206048178-012925f7-1f4c-4893-9eda-84788c8cf8d7.png)
  - [ ] Material testing certification shall be provided for: manufacturer name and/or trademark, thickkness, R-value, insulation density, flame retardants for lining and adhesives. Both UL181 (mould growth, temperature, puncture, loading, impact, pressure, collapse, tension and burning) and AS1530 (smoke developed index not greater than three and spread-of-flame index less than zero) tests should be provided for all ducting componets. 
  - [ ] Ktichen ductwork shall be galvanised/stainless steel with no internal masonry and able to be accessed for cleaning the ducting and plenum, including access points at each duct junction and at intervals of three metres.
  - [ ] Sealing of rigid ductwork must provide a static pressure seal: adhesives mastics, gaskets, welding, lock seams, scams, transverse/girth joints, branching, intersections, terminal connections access doors/panels, casing and abustments to building structures.
  - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146181/206049639-dd401958-c91a-442a-a85c-7ef4932317ab.png)
  - [ ] Duct systems with a capacity of 3000 L/s or greater shall be tested for air leakage (see Section 2 Tables in Part 2 AS4254).  Records for each test result should include all seams, tie-rods, circumferential joints, flange joints, longitudal seams, sealant type/length, operating pressure per section, test pressure and air leakage.
  - [ ] Hangers and support systems for ducting shall comply with galzanisation as per AS1443 and be connected to load bearing building connections.  For 'fire rated ducts' the suspension systems shall have the same Fire Resistence Level (FRL) required by the National Construction Code.  Nata test certificates for load and safety factors shall be provided.

  - [ ] Duct liners shall be installed in the direction of airstream without gaps and butted against transverse joints with foil-pressure sensitive tape and comply with AS 1530 Part 3, including smoke development index not greater than three and a flame index not greater than zero as per AS1530.
  - [ ] Insulation for thermal and/or acoustic ratings must prevent cold bridging, maintain vapour barrier and be in contact with duct surface.
  - [ ] External ducting must have connections (flanged) and penetrations (curbs) which are suitable for the weather and aesthetic of the building and be fastened/caulked for routine maintenace access.  Sealants must form positive airtight and watertight seals with a service range temperature from -10C to +78C.
