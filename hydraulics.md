# Ducting


## Flexible ductwork
AS 4254 Part 1
Checklist for flexible pipe ducting for liquids and air handling:
 - [ ] Provide evidence for airtight, vapour-tight and UV stabalised ducting including the jacket-sleeve, duct-tape, sealant and mastics which encapsulates the ducting pipes.  Both UL181 (mould growth, temperature, puncture, loading, impact, pressure, collapse, tension and burning) and AS1530 (smoke developed index not greater than three and spread-of-flame index less than zero) tests should be provided for all ducting componets.

 - [ ] Joints connecting flexible ducting (to terminals, rigid ducts, duct joiners, etc) must be sealed (collars, jackets, ducting tape, sealants, etc)

 - [ ] Ducts must be supported using load distribution systems structurally connected to weightbearing building elements to assure no sagging, shaffing and/or distoration.

 - [ ] Corners and bends in ductwork must be supported before and after bend.  Sharp edges shall be trimmed to prevent punctures.

 - [ ] Ducting shall be labelled including name of manufacturer, conformance/testing requirements and insulation R-value.

## Rigid ductwork
Checklist for rigid ductwork primarily for air handling as per AS 4254 Part 2:
  - [ ] Ductwork shall have a pressure classification appropriate to use.
