# structural materials for external load-bearing walls in commercial buildings
Earthsteading Ltd has taken a comprehensive survey of primary buildings materials to support the environmental and engineering needs for commercial buildings in the future (see references below).  While any of these builind materials have their advantages and disadvantages, it is clear from the following analysis that earth-based building materials (_rammed earth, hemp bricks, straw bale, adobe and earthen renders_) have been widely ignored in the Australian building industry due to their complexity to categorise and lack of performance testing.  And yet, because of the increasing need for building materials which are sustainable and enduring, the future clearly has a place for earthen-products as a primary construction material which naturally integrate with the use of timber, steel and concrete.

## Analysis of primary structural materials for commercial structures:
 - [x] [timber](https://github.com/earthsteading/commercial-buildings/blob/main/timber.md)
 - [x] [brickwork](https://github.com/earthsteading/commercial-buildings/blob/main/brickwork.md)
 - [x] [concrete](https://github.com/earthsteading/commercial-buildings/blob/main/concrete.md)
 - [ ] steel: containers, colorbond warehouses/shed, etc
 - [ ] earth: rammed earth, hemp bricks, straw bale, adobe, earthen concretes and renders

Each of the above load-bearing construction materials were evaluated against:
 - [x] Vertical forces, e.g. permanent action (gravity), imposed actions,
 - [x] Lateral forces, e.g. wind action (cyclonic/non), snow action, earthquanke action
 - [x] Resistence model for individual construction component, e.g. mechanical properties of material and variation in dimension from fabrication/construction process
 - [x] Robustness characteristics, e.g. lateral loading, absorption of impact, toleration for movement, load distribution.
 - [x] Randomised uncertainties in the modelling of forces, components and robustness.

Out of scope evaluation (due to complexity):
 - [ ] accidental actions
 - [ ] acceptable extent of damanage preceeding failure
