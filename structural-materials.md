# structural materials for external load-bearing walls in commercial buildings

Earthsteading Ltd has taken a comprehensive survey of primary buildings materials to support the environmental and engineering needs for commercial buildings in the future (see references below).  While any of these builind materials have their advantages and disadvantages, it is clear from the following analysis that earth-based building materials (_rammed earth, hemp bricks, straw bale, adobe and earthen renders_) have been widely ignored in the Australian building industry due to their complexity to categorise and lack of performance testing.  And yet, because of the increasing need for building materials which are sustainable and enduring, the future clearly has a place for earthen-products as a primary construction material which naturally integrate with the use of timber, steel and concrete.
