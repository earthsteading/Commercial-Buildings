## Checklists

### Notes from AIBS webinars by Mark Porter
Notes from @AIBS webinar on AS2419 Fire Hydrants with Mark Porter Station Officer from NSW Fire & Rescue.

(a) Assessing your risk in complying hydrant solutions: if a fire happens in a building you've provided compliance for, the court will decide if you are: competent / ignorant / incompetent. Decide what level of risk you want to take and what risk your hydraulics/fire engineer is going to take.

(b) AS2419 provides another level of compliance above DtS, however it does not cater for buildings larger than 108,000 cubic metres. Sprinkler protected builidings continue to have exceptions. Appendix C, D & E provides prescriptive designs for highrise, large isolated buildings and special hazard areas.

(c) Deciding which compliance requirement applies (NCC DtS, AS2419 or Performance Solution): specified by floor area/volume, height (135m), fire compartment, hydrant number/pressure, etc.

(d) Hydraulic consultants will provide "bounding construction" guidelines for determining fire life safety system performance.

(e) Fire load, flow and number of hydrants must be considered by surveyors/certifiers as it will vary building to building. To be considered is access to hydrants both internal and external, as follows:

(f) How will the brigade truck accesses which pumpsets (pump, drive, coupling): (1) half duty fire hydrant pumpset, (2) full duty fire hydrant pumpset, (3) pressure maintenance pumps, (4) secondary water supply pumps. All hydrants must be classified as either internal or external.

(g) Where is the access to hydrants, pumps and water feeds: (1) attack fire hydrants (internal/external), (2) on-site tanks and pumps. In particular the suction required to draw water from a tank must not exceed distance to assure the fire truck can pump the water for fighting fires.

(h) Appendix F provides an informative guide on brigade, pumping appliances, operations and strategies for controlling and extinguishing fires.

(i) Changes to standard of note: (1) coverage to all parts of the floor area, (2) 500mm clearance from swing arc of door in fire stair, (3) orientation of internal fire hydrants in stairs should point to descending stair, (4) street hydrants and booster assemblies require consideration, (5) Electric vehicle charging station are included in the standard re distance from building, (6) limitations on use of external fire hydrant distances per storey and open yards, (7) measurement of hose is from both hydrant and parking for fire truck, see Appendix H, (8) internal hydrants coverage of 45m for Class 2, 3 & 4, (9) method of measurements are detailed and requires a hydraulic engineer.

## Typical schematic drawings
The following set of schematics are used for assuring the inspection requirements are met against the standard.
