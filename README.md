## Site preparation for commerical structures:
  - [ ] prepare site for concrete plant conditions
  - [ ] potential equipment: excavators, mobile cranes, dumpers (tracked or rail mounted machines for wet/sloping sites)
  - [ ] site limitations: access considerations for tall/adjoing buildings, e.g. derrick jib crane vs horizontal jib crane, use of large lifts to accomodate climbing cranes, etc.
  - [ ] Site plan to include: (a) traffic routes with slopes and signs, (b) location of office, hutes, stores, amenities and short term vehicle parking, (c) position of bulk storage and equipment locations both before and after excavation, (d) temporary fencing, (e) proximity to overhead power lines, (f) redirection of services, (g) road traffic control, (h) site personal vehicles parking, (i) location of materials delivery, (j) location of site crane.
  - [ ] Foreman to provide copies of site plan including overall programme, schedule of contact information, data sheets, bills of quantities, specifications, set of contract drawings, details of material orders to be placed with corresponding dates, and details and quatity of equipment schedules.

## Plant and Equipment 
  - [ ] Excavators and rigging: (a) for loading the spoil into transport equipment: face shovel, backacter, skimmer, dragline, crane and grab, (b) pile driver and hanging leaders for drilling cylinder piles and piling timber and precast concrete (>12m), crawler tracks (vs pneumatic tyred wheels), (c) rigging for driving piles: jib platform or boom is equiped with a turntable through which square drilling rod (aka Kelly bar) passes + driling auger and supported via cable.
  - [ ] Mobile cranes (self propelled or truck mounted) rigging: (a) low pivot derrick jib (strut or suspension cable), (b) slew (turning mechanism) or wheeled cranes, depending on turning radius required.
  - [ ] Self-propelled crane rigging: (a) pneumatic tyres on hard ground, or crawler-mounted crane for unprepared ground, (b) slew jibs or derrick fly jib with hydraulic jack (for confined spaces with small loads).
  - [ ] Stationary cranes: fixed base cranes, especially for elevated work.
  - [ ] Derrick cranes (Guy or Scotch) 5-10 tonnes capacity and up to 45 metres long for multi-ctorey buildings: (a) mast length accounting for load and radii, (b) mono braced tower up to 60m high with solid foundation, (c) pivot bearing, slew ring and counter jib (or boom with counterweight ballast), (d) driver's cabin and controls.
  - [ ] Climbing cranes (built inside or on external face of structure) (a) short fixed mast (raised floor by floor), (b) anchor at base of building, (c) lifting frames / collars and flanged wheels are fitted around mast per upper floor, (d) hand/power winch with hoisting cables wdged into collars to transfer load to the floor on which it rests, (e) mounting on lift shaft depending concrete reinforcement shuttering.

## Excavations
 - [ ] Site factors (details below): (a) soil type and classification, (b) depth of excavation, (c) removal of excavated material (d) acces to excavated material, (e) support of adjacent structures (f) water intrusion.
 - [ ] Soil type: as per geotechnical report
 - [ ] Depth of excavation for deep basement construction: (a) stage excavation procedure to account for changes in soil stress and water table, (b) monitorring of adjoining buildings and transferred stress to foundation, (c) underpinning methods to ensure foundations of adjoining buildings.
 - [ ] Removal of excavated material: (a) ongoing access pathways for trucks, (b) signage, and (c) site traffic control, (d) underpinning methods to ensure foundations of adjoining buildings.
 - [ ] Water intrustion monitorring: water table, underground streams and/or storms.
 - [ ] Effect of site works: (a) site factors including: controlled fill, rolled fill, treament of sloping sites, effects of fill, (b) monitorring of site cuts, including: increase in movement of reactive soil layers, clay fill, settlement caused by the weight of fill atop underlying weaker foundation layers.

## Slab fill and soil stabalisation options
 - [ ] Controled fills: (a) piles/piers to bedrock, (b) uncontrolled underfill, (c) slab and beam atop piers
 - [ ] Sand fills: 800mm deep compacted in layers of 300mm thick by vibrating plate or roller.
 - [ ] Non-sand fill: up to 400mm deep, compacted by layers of 150mm deep by a mechanical roller (smooth face drum or rams foot).
 - [ ] Rolled fill: rolled fill of sand should not be deeper than 600mm with 300mm compacted layers, repeatedly rolled with excavator.  Materials other than sand should be compacted at 150mm thick.
 - [ ] Sloping sites using cut-and-fill: compacted fill must be carried pas the edge of the building evelope by +1m which is retained/battered to prevent erosion (not steeper than 2horizontal:1vertical).
 - [ ] Engineer designed retaining walls for piling.
 - [ ] Fill/soil stabalisation: (a) bearing capacity can be increased via removal of poor quality clay/foundation and replaced with +1m of above ^^ fill methods (provided adequate soil settlement prior to beuild commencing); (b) use of lime to stabalise water-logged clay soils, e.g. add up to 10% lime blended and compacted/rolled/vibrated in 150mm layers which reduces plasticity of soil, increases strenth/bearing capacity and drains more freely.  NB must use hydrated lime aka builder's lime (calcium oxide Ca0), NOT agricultural lime (calcium carbonate CaCO3).

## Soil report
  - [ ] Site classification report (as per AS2870) including: soil type, site description, soil profile, laboratory results, site classification, spot levels, site plans, site photography and permeability test.
  - [ ] Soil testing (2m deep cores with 100m diameter) to determine design of: (a) footing and slab, (b) column and mullion pads, (c) strip footing and floor slabs.
  - [ ] Feasability study and report
