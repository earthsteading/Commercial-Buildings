  - [ ] Mobile cranes (self propelled or truck mounted) rigging: (a) low pivot derrick jib (strut or suspension cable), (b) slew (turning mechanism) or wheeled cranes, depending on turning radius required.
  - [ ] Self-propelled crane rigging: (a) pneumatic tyres on hard ground, or crawler-mounted crane for unprepared ground, (b) slew jibs or derrick fly jib with hydraulic jack (for confined spaces with small loads).
  - [ ] Stationary cranes: fixed base cranes, especially for elevated work.

## Excavations
 - [ ] Site factors (details below): (a) soil type and classification, (b) depth of excavation, (c) removal of excavated material (d) acces to excavated material, (e) support of adjacent structures (f) water intrusion.
 - [ ] Soil type: as per geotechnical report

 - [ ] Removal of excavated material: (a) ongoing access pathways for trucks, (b) signage, and (c) site traffic control, (d) underpinning methods to ensure foundations of adjoining buildings.
 - [ ] Water intrustion monitorring: water table, underground streams and/or storms.

## Slab fill and soil stabalisation options
 - [ ] Controled fills: (a) piles/piers to bedrock, (b) uncontrolled underfill, (c) slab and beam atop piers
 - [ ] Sand fills: 800mm deep compacted in layers of 300mm thick by vibrating plate or roller.
 - [ ] Non-sand fill: up to 400mm deep, compacted by layers of 150mm deep by a mechanical roller (smooth face drum or rams foot).
 - [ ] Rolled fill: rolled fill of sand should not be deeper than 600mm with 300mm compacted layers, repeatedly rolled with excavator.  Materials other than sand should be compacted at 150mm thick.
 - [ ] Sloping sites using cut-and-fill: compacted fill must be carried pas the edge of the building evelope by +1m which is retained/battered to prevent erosion (not steeper than 2horizontal:1vertical).
 - [ ] Engineer designed retaining walls for piling.
 - [ ] Fill/soil stabalisation: (a) bearing capacity can be increased via removal of poor quality clay/foundation and replaced with +1m of above ^^ fill methods (provided adequate soil settlement prior to beuild commencing); (b) use of lime to stabalise water-logged clay soils, e.g. add up to 10% lime blended and compacted/rolled/vibrated in 150mm layers which reduces plasticity of soil, increases strenth/bearing capacity and drains more freely.  NB must use hydrated lime aka builder's lime (calcium oxide Ca0), NOT agricultural lime (calcium carbonate CaCO3).

## Footings for commercial structures
 - [ ] Types of footings (below): spread footing, wide strip footing, reinforced concrete pads, continous columns footing, combinedfooting , raft footing, solid footing, beam and slab, cellular, pile footing (friction or displacement piles, end bearing, pile groups).
 - [ ] Type of piles/piers (below): driven tube piles, toe driven tube piles, timber piles, stell piles, bored piles, cylinder piles, auger-fed piles, jacked piles, rectangular concrete piles, soil compacting piles and pier cylinder+monolith (caison) footings.  Under pinings: continous or piled.
 - [ ] Spread footing: weak soil and/or heavy lods require wide spread resulting in a thick mass of concrete which are excessively deep
 - [ ] Wide strip footing: for load-bearing walls including brick/concrete for multi-storey buildings.
 - [ ] Reinforced concrete pads footings: reinforced rectangular slab carrying a single column.
 - [ ] Continous column footing: supports line of columns via combined footing, which is different than continous strip footing which is for load-bearing brick/concrete panels.
 - [ ] Combined footing: cantilever footing + balanced base footing (used as alternative to trapevoidal combined footing slab, or for providing a footing when a column position is not directly below, e.g. when placed clost to an adjoining property wall.
 - [ ] Raft footings (below are large slab footings to cover the whole or a large part of the site).
 - [ ] Solid slab raft: reinforced in both directions 't' rebar ties.
 - [ ] Beam and slab raft: thick (300mm) slab on floor with beams projecting above it.
 - [ ] Cellular raft: for commercial high stress rigidity (deep 900mm) with both top and bottom slabs with edge intermediate beams in both directions forming a hollow cellular raft.
 - [ ] Normal cellular raft: basements encased slab which is monolithic and diveds entire basement into cellular compartments.

## Piling for commercial structures
 - [ ] Factors for utiling pilings: (a) load bearing capacity of soil (friction of pile), (b) high water table, (c) type of structure being built, (d) geological conditions found on site, e.g. to reach bedrock like foundation aka 'end bearing' on limestone or friction of clay on pile to retain position, (e) special design needs, e.g. resistence to slip, (f) specification/standards relating to construction type.

A geotechnical engineer monitors utilising Pile Driver Analyzer (PDA) equipment to generate the 'driving criteria letter'.
 - [ ] Issue 'Driving Criteria Letter' sets the required: (a) blow couts based on hammer engergy stroke (control stresses) during early driving and 'practical refusal', and (b) hammer/cushion equipment and material used for production pile program, which includes guidelines for pile/hammer cushion replacement.
 - [ ] Issue 'Pile Lengths Letter' authorising pile lengths so Contractor can order the correct length of concrete piles from the pre-stres yard.

## note on screw piles
  - [ ] Screw piles have a lengthy history of use in difficult conditions including sea piers and other harsh conditions.  
  - [ ] Screw pile use in commercial construction: replacing bored piers and CFA piles, replacing driven piles, replacing blinding concrete, replacing concrete pads and stumps for timber floors, load capacities up to 2400Kn ultimate, unlimited length potential, commercial high rise up to 6 storeys, angle of repose for easements and sewer and for eco-sensitive sites.
  - [ ] Screw pile use in civil construction: foundations for light poles and transmission towers, foundations for signs, foundations for bridges and walkways, ground and land slip stabilisation, foundations for shade structures.
