## Slab fill and soil stabalisation options
 - [ ] Controled fills: (a) piles/piers to bedrock, (b) uncontrolled underfill, (c) slab and beam atop piers
 - [ ] Sand fills: 800mm deep compacted in layers of 300mm thick by vibrating plate or roller.
 - [ ] Non-sand fill: up to 400mm deep, compacted by layers of 150mm deep by a mechanical roller (smooth face drum or rams foot).
 - [ ] Rolled fill: rolled fill of sand should not be deeper than 600mm with 300mm compacted layers, repeatedly rolled with excavator.  Materials other than sand should be compacted at 150mm thick.
 - [ ] Sloping sites using cut-and-fill: compacted fill must be carried pas the edge of the building evelope by +1m which is retained/battered to prevent erosion (not steeper than 2horizontal:1vertical).
 - [ ] Engineer designed retaining walls for piling.
 - [ ] Fill/soil stabalisation: (a) bearing capacity can be increased via removal of poor quality clay/foundation and replaced with +1m of above ^^ fill methods (provided adequate soil settlement prior to beuild commencing); (b) use of lime to stabalise water-logged clay soils, e.g. add up to 10% lime blended and compacted/rolled/vibrated in 150mm layers which reduces plasticity of soil, increases strenth/bearing capacity and drains more freely.  NB must use hydrated lime aka builder's lime (calcium oxide Ca0), NOT agricultural lime (calcium carbonate CaCO3).

## Footings for commercial structures
 - [ ] Types of footings (below): spread footing, wide strip footing, reinforced concrete pads, continous columns footing, combinedfooting , raft footing, solid footing, beam and slab, cellular, pile footing (friction or displacement piles, end bearing, pile groups).
