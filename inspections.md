# Inspections of commerical structures
While legislation only requires a minimum of five inspections for a building, it was [recommended by the ABCB in 2020 that a risk based approach is utilised for evaluating inspections for commerical buildings](https://consultation.abcb.gov.au/engagement/mandatory-inspections/supporting_documents/Discussion_paper_Mandatory_Inspections_A_response_to_the_BCR.pdf).

## Standards / Legislation

 - Certificate of compliance = certicicate issued for a prescribed structural component or design element which gives the statuatory building surveyor immunity.

## Building complexity levels
Minimum inspections determined by risk based assessment and liaison with engineers re appropriate inspections points.
  - [ ] low, e.g. residential single family home: (a) foundation, (b) structural frames, (c) reinforecement, (d) pools, (e) wet areas, (f) final inspection
  - [ ] medium, e.g. office building +25m height:  (all of the above) + (g) performance solutions, (h) facade/cladding, (i) fire detection/supression, (j) wall; lining/plastering including: thermal/acoustic, sarking, weatherproofing, condensation mitigation, non-combustable elements, (k) fire-rated compartments including walls, floors, shafts, building seperation and openings;
  - [ ] high, e.g. building +3 storey with +100 occupants: (all of the above) + (l) witness testing of fire safety systems and evacuation operations.
  - [ ] All inspections evaluated against NCC Vol.1 and/or Performance Solution via skilled practitioner.
