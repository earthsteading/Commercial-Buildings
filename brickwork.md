## History of Brickwork use in Australia
 - [ ] One of the oldest known building materials, dating back to 7000 BCE in Sourthern Turkey (ancient site of Jericho, where "the walls came tumbling down").
 - [ ] Used by Romans for small and large buildings including 5th century BC at Ostia show.
 - [ ] Used by English in Hampton Court Palance in the 16th century.
 - [ ] Used in Holland and Flanders for merchant houses throughout the 15th century.
 - [ ] Used by American Thomas Jefferson at this Monticello plantation in the 18th century.
 - [ ] Used in Australia for public buildings like Greenway's Hyde Park Barracks in 1817 and St Mathew's church at Windsor in 1820.
 - [ ] By the 19th century kilns were in widespread use enabling greater production of polychromatic brick (vs stone bricks).
 - [ ] Polychromatic brickwork in Australia, became known as "Fderation style" architecture (aka 'blood & bandage' tapestry brickwork) and dominated Edwardian city facades.
 - [ ] John Hornbury Hunt was an Australian architect who produced Roman-esque arched/gabled buildings like the Anglican Church in Kangaroo valley (1872) and larger cathedrals like St. Peter's at Armidale in 1897.  His succes is attributed to the details testing and inspection of the brickwork in his buildings.
 - [ ] Modern brickwork movements included the Amsterdam school at Berlage (1956-1934) kwown as Art Noveua style.
 - [ ] Frank Lloyd Wright in addition to concrete utilised novel brickwork designs at Oak Park house, Robie house and other brickwork arches.
 - [ ] American art deco utilised brickwork for non-loadbearing cladding including New York skyscrapers Fred F French building (1927) and the Chanin building (1929) both designed by architects Sloan and Robertson.
 - [ ] Anderson house built in Carlton using pre-fabricated brick panels in the 1980's was built by the Victorian Operative Bricklayer's Society by builders Civil and Civic and contributed to the fire safety (FRL) of the internal structural steel framing.

Advantages
 - [ ] scalable production and assembly due to uniformity of bricks.
 - [ ] multipple color and pattern combinations
 - [ ] good thermal mass
 - [ ] durable: if built the right way brick buildings last the longest in comparison to timber and even concrete.
 - [ ] minimal maitenance: doesn't require coatings once constructed

Disadvantages
 -  [ ] suseptable to lateral (compression) forces like wind and earthquakes

### Methods
 - [ ] Type of brickwork for openings: arches, doors, windows
 - [ ] Loadbearing brickwork (corbelling): cantalivers, columns, arches, butresses, etc.
 - [ ] Non loadbearing: cladding and brick veneer
 - [ ] Coatings: render (coating with cement, sand and lime), bagging (mortar mix flushed through hessian bag), paint (cement based and acrylic as per ASNZ2311).
 - [ ] Brick making: (a) clay deposits are hydrated silicates and aluminates with impurities like iron oxide ergo red bricks, (b) colour (mineralogy of clay and kiln temperature/fuel like wagga oil and sawdust), (c) texture (granular, fine, smooth, speckled conglomerate), (d) grind size (clay/shale particle grinding down to 1.5-2mm particles up to +3mm course particles), (e) re-pressing to achieve smoother textures and remove deformities from firing, (f) shrinkage during firing must be accounted for as per AS/NZS4455, (g) hardness is imparted by vitirfication (plastic clays vitrify at lower temperatures), (h) oxidation, reduction, flashes, oxides and weather will affect colour and tone during kiln process, (i) frit and surface additives like glass to create different textures.
 - [ ] Brick selection: (a) texture (dry pressed bricks, smoother bricks for self-cleaning via rain, etc), (b) use of combined brick suppliers to obtain a variety of texture/color, (c) arris edges must be crisp and corners unbroken, (d) hardness for use in door and window reveals to limit wear and tear, (e) expansion characteristics and slip joints (AS4456), (f) brick size tolerance (3-5mm is common), (g) extrusion holes provide greater rigidity but consume more mortar down the holes, and (h) brick availability (large clay deposits must be utilised with ample time to order a significant quantity of bricks).
 - [ ] Prefabricated brickwork methods: (a) extruded bricks with 50mm diameter holes for vertically alignment in a stretcher bond with vertical steel reinforcing rods grouted into selected holes.  Brick walls held together by lifting hardware (steal stud winner walls) and'or reinforced bed joints.  (b) thin cast bricks (12mm thick) into a precast concrete panels.  Advantages of precast brick walls are less delays due to bad weather, no scaffolding required onsite, better quality control. Disadvantages: longer lead time to assemble than on-site brickwork, not widely used or understood by structural engineers, cranes required to lift panels, better thermal performance.
 - [ ] Principles for achieving reliable brickwork: (a) quality control required, (b) detailed drawings including colours, textures, levels, rods, alignments, flashing, supports, juctions and clearly measured layouts, (c) obtain sample bricks and panels, (d) pre-sort bricks to assure they are dimensionally compatible, (e) consider pre-fabricated.
 - [ ] Loadbearing bricks: (a) walls must be continous from top to bottom to carry loads, (b) each column-panel must be secured at top and bottom to assure stability, (c) litels in openings must have the same Fire Resistence Level as the brick walls, (d) to support floor loads the span of timber joists, concrete slabs and steel must be calculated against brick wall tolerances for each, (e) if the internal space requires spans then columns may be used, brick columns are usually strengthed by intersecting right angles which create stability along with compression forces of columns gravitation weight, (f) for multi-storey builidngs (up to 3 storeys) the internal walls can carry the loads of the span allowing external walls to be more uniform in design, (g) for storey heigh more than 2.5m+ expertise for the piers to reinforce the brickwork are required, (h) for multi-storey buildings of 10+ storeys the requirements for calculating wind loads must be calculated to provide an adequate seperate structural frame, (i) for brick on slabfootings the calculation for expanding brickwork to shrinking concrete must be certified, e.g. use of a bond breaking layer (aluminium-cored or zincalume dampcourse) prevents the slab from bonding to the brick wall, which would otehrwise crack, (j) for slab floors resting on brick walls consideration for different thermal movements between the two must be calculated.
 - [ ] Non-loadbearing walls and brick veneers: (a) soft joints must be used when loadbearing brick walls abutt non-loadbearing walls to assure loards are not imposed on the external veneer brick wall, (b) special joints have been developed to enable internal cavity loadbearing walls and non-loadbearing veneer brick walls to be connected to one another assuring restraint in one direction and not the other, e.g. sliding a flattened tube inside a larger one, (c) in commercial buildings it is common to use pasterboard on steel studs for internal walls and brickwork for external perimeter walls with walls ties to the steel studs, (d) brick veneer also enables an additional layer of thermal insulation between the studs.
 - [ ] horizontal reinforcement in walls and spans: (a) precast concrete and/or brickwork lintels are used to assure visual consistency with veneer and assure the strength of the lintel span for fire ratings, (b) litels must be fire rated to the same as the brick, e.g. use of steel/concrete would require protective covers, (c) loadbearing frames remove the requirements for a loadbearing lintel which also enables greater openings to be spanned, (d) wall anchors must be used to tie non-loadbearing brickwork to the frame but also allow for movement, esp expansion, (e) modern mortar has allowed for greater strength in bending tension thereby requiring less stuctural framework, e.g. walls are laid in half-brick thickness 110mm for standard metric bricks, (f) wire reinforcement into bed joints is the simplest reinforcement, e.g. a ladder of 3-6mm diameter galvanized/stainless wire laid longitudally and supported at both ends, (g) vertical reinforcement can also be achieved by creating continous voids in the bond pattern, and then use of mortar and purpose made bricks for holes in pattern with optinoal reinforcement bars,
 - [ ] Brick sizes: (a) standard metric brick is 130x110x76mm high, (b) metric modular brick is 90x290x90 high, (c) addition of mortar joints a standard module of bricks would be seven courses of 86mm would make up a height of 602mm, (d) custom brick sizes are made to accomodate for fire safety and acoustic thickness, (e) size tolerance is defined by AS/NZS4455.
 - [ ] Mortar joints: (a) normal thickness is ~10mm as defined by AS3700, (b) water shedding for surface joints is required, (c) mortar mix is 1:1:6 cement, lime and sand mortar mix depending on coloring, (d) type of joints include slip joints, flush joints, control joints, etc, (e) cleaning of joints should be kept to a minimum to avoid erosion from water jet spray pressure, (f) thermal movement of brickwork requires a 0.35mm/m tolerance especially if fresh from kiln (6 months to 5 years) as per AS4456, (g) use of brick and concrete increase movement tolerances required, e.g. concrete shrinks, brick expands, (h) load-bearing walls will shorten slightly from vertical loads and should be calculated when use of multiple materials is used as per AS3700, (i) control joints and horizontal soft joints are utilised to account for movements.
 - [ ] Damp proof course and drainage: (a) bricks absorb water and must enable drainage at the bottom of the wall, (b) cavities in walls must provide flashing to drain water to outside, (c) a layer of damp proof course must be used under the full thickness of the inside leaf to break bond to avoid stresses when the concrete shrinks and the brickwork becomes expands, (d) a minimum cavity of 40-50mm is essential, if insulation is used it should be a rigid board to avoid sagging and help against inner skin to maintain cavity width, (e) flashing and weepholes for each floor level where the beam/slab crosses the cavity, (f) head and sill flashings must be provided at door and window openings to provide overhang above jambs, (g) metal ties and inclusions must resist corrosion, e.g. galvanized and stainless steel should be used as per AS/NZS2699.
 - [ ] Thermal insulation of brick: (a) thermal transmittance (u-value) is low as is minimum resistance (R-value), (b) insulation is usually closed-cell foam such as expanded polystyrene, (c) cavities can be filled with closed cell foam avoiding honeycombing, (d) plasterboard lined with insulation is easy to install but not as durable.
 - [ ] Acoustic and fire resistance of walls: (a) joints, openings and holes in brick walls enahance noise/radiation, (b) a single leaf brick wall with plaster will reduce airborne noise by 55dB, (c) fire resistence failure is due to cracking due to thermal expansion from heat, not fire damage to the material itself.
