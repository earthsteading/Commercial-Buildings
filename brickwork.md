## History of Brickwork use in Australia
 - [ ] One of the oldest known building materials, dating back to 7000 BCE in Sourthern Turkey (ancient site of Jericho, where "the walls came tumbling down").
 - [ ] Used by Romans for small and large buildings including 5th century BC at Ostia show.
 - [ ] Used by English in Hampton Court Palance in the 16th century.
 - [ ] Used in Holland and Flanders for merchant houses throughout the 15th century.
 - [ ] Used by American Thomas Jefferson at this Monticello plantation in the 18th century.
 - [ ] Used in Australia for public buildings like Greenway's Hyde Park Barracks in 1817 and St Mathew's church at Windsor in 1820.
 - [ ] By the 19th century kilns were in widespread use enabling greater production of polychromatic brick (vs stone bricks).
 - [ ] Polychromatic brickwork in Australia, became known as "Fderation style" architecture (aka 'blood & bandage' tapestry brickwork) and dominated Edwardian city facades.
 - [ ] John Hornbury Hunt was an Australian architect who produced Roman-esque arched/gabled buildings like the Anglican Church in Kangaroo valley (1872) and larger cathedrals like St. Peter's at Armidale in 1897.  His succes is attributed to the details testing and inspection of the brickwork in his buildings.
 - [ ] Modern brickwork movements included the Amsterdam school at Berlage (1956-1934) kwown as Art Noveua style.
 - [ ] Frank Lloyd Wright in addition to concrete utilised novel brickwork designs at Oak Park house, Robie house and other brickwork arches.
 - [ ] American art deco utilised brickwork for non-loadbearing cladding including New York skyscrapers Fred F French building (1927) and the Chanin building (1929) both designed by architects Sloan and Robertson.
 - [ ] Anderson house built in Carlton using pre-fabricated brick panels in the 1980's was built by the Victorian Operative Bricklayer's Society by builders Civil and Civic and contributed to the fire safety (FRL) of the internal structural steel framing.

Advantages
 - [ ] scalable production and assembly due to uniformity of bricks.
 - [ ] multipple color and pattern combinations
 - [ ] good thermal mass
 - [ ] durable: if built the right way brick buildings last the longest in comparison to timber and even concrete.
 - [ ] minimal maitenance: doesn't require coatings once constructed

Disadvantages
 -  [ ] asdf

### Methods
 - [ ] Type of brickwork for openings: arches, doors, windows
 - [ ] Loadbearing brickwork (corbelling): cantalivers, columns, arches, butresses, etc.
 - [ ] Non loadbearing: cladding
 - [ ] Coatings: render (coating with cement, sand and lime), bagging (mortar mix flushed through hessian bag), paint (cement based and acrylic as per ASNZ2311).
 - [ ] Brick making: (a) clay deposits are hydrated silicates and aluminates with impurities like iron oxide ergo red bricks, (b) colour (mineralogy of clay and kiln temperature/fuel like wagga oil and sawdust), (c) texture (granular, fine, smooth, speckled conglomerate), (d) grind size (clay/shale particle grinding down to 1.5-2mm particles up to +3mm course particles), (e) re-pressing to achieve smoother textures and remove deformities from firing, (f) shrinkage during firing must be accounted for as per AS/NZS4455, (g) hardness is imparted by vitirfication (plastic clays vitrify at lower temperatures), (h) oxidation, reduction, flashes, oxides and weather will affect colour and tone during kiln process, (i) frit and surface additives like glass to create different textures.
 - [ ] Brick selection: (a) texture (dry pressed bricks, smoother bricks for self-cleaning via rain, etc), (b) use of combined brick suppliers to obtain a variety of texture/color, (c) arris edges must be crisp and corners unbroken, (d) hardness for use in door and window reveals to limit wear and tear, (e) expansion characteristics and slip joints (AS4456), (f) brick size tolerance (3-5mm is common), (g) extrusion holes provide greater rigidity but consume more mortar down the holes, and (h) brick availability (large clay deposits must be utilised with ample time to order a significant quantity of bricks).
 - [ ] Prefabricated brickwork methods: (a) extruded bricks with 50mm diameter holes for vertically alignment in a stretcher bond with vertical steel reinforcing rods grouted into selected holes.  Brick walls held together by lifting hardware (steal stud winner walls) and'or reinforced bed joints.  (b) thin cast bricks (12mm thick) into a precast concrete panels.  Advantages of precast brick walls are less delays due to bad weather, no scaffolding required onsite, better quality control. Disadvantages: longer lead time to assemble than on-site brickwork, not widely used or understood by structural engineers, cranes required to lift panels, better thermal performance.
 - [ ] Principles for achieving reliable brickwork: (a) quality control required, (b) detailed drawings including colours, textures, levels, rods, alignments, flashing, supports, juctions and clearly measured layouts, (c) obtain sample bricks and panels, (d) pre-sort bricks to assure they are dimensionally compatible, (e) consider pre-fabricated.
 - [ ] Loadbearing bricks: (a) walls must be continous from top to bottom to carry loads, (b) each column-panel must be secured at top and bottom to assure stability, (c) litels in openings must have the same Fire Resistence Level as the brick walls, (d) to support floor loads the span of timber joists, concrete slabs and steel must be calculated against brick wall tolerances for each, (e) if the internal space requires spans then columns may be used, brick columns are usually strengthed by intersecting right angles which create stability along with compression forces of columns gravitation weight, (f) for multi-storey builidngs (up to 3 storeys) the internal walls can carry the loads of the span allowing external walls to be more uniform in design, (g) for storey heigh more than 2.5m+ expertise for the piers to reinforce the brickwork are required, (h) for multi-storey buildings of 10+ storeys the requirements for calculating wind loads must be calculated to provide an adequate seperate structural frame, (i) for brick on slabfootings the calculation for expanding brickwork to shrinking concrete must be certified, e.g. use of a bond breaking layer (aluminium-cored or zincalume dampcourse) prevents the slab from bonding to the brick wall, which would otehrwise crack, (j) for slab floors resting on brick walls consideration for different thermal movements between the two must be calculated.
